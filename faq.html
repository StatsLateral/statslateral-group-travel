    "items": [
      {"q": "Who is Vybri for?", "a": "Vybri is built for independent healthcare and wellness providers. We are currently live and available for professionals who do not deliver medical diagnoses or prescriptions. This includes health and weight loss coaches, nutritionists, physical therapists, cancer survivorship coaches, doulas, lactation consultants, and other non-physician professionals. If you offer wellness, preventive, or supportive care services and want to build a scalable, digital-first practice, Vybri is the ideal solution for you. If you are a medical or healthcare professional, please contact us to discuss your practice requirements."},
      {"q": "What makes Vybri different from other platforms?", "a": "Vybri is designed to empower wellness professionals. Our platform enables you to transform your session insights into personalized care plans, re-engage clients asynchronously, and increase income without sacrificing more time for sessions. You maintain control; AI works for you in the background. Unlike generic scheduling or patient engagement tools, Vybri combines AI-powered personalization, passive income capabilities, and content automation tailored to wellness and preventive care."},
      {"q": "What if I don’t have digital wellness resources like eBooks or videos?", "a": "No problem. Vybri can help you create them. You can record voice notes or upload rough outlines, and our AI-enabled service (launching soon - contact us) will turn that into a professional-grade eBook, digital guide, blog post, voice-based podcast episode, or video. These resources are then packaged and shared with clients in just a few clicks."},
      {"q": "How do personalized care plans work?", "a": "Clients interact with your shared content by entering their goals and challenges. Vybri’s AI, using only your original material (not the internet), creates a tailored plan specific to that client’s input. This plan includes structured guidance, checklists, and next steps—all branded to your professional voice."},
      {"q": "How do subscriptions work on Vybri?", "a": "Once a client engages with a resource or care plan, you can invite them to subscribe to ongoing services. Subscriptions can include personalized plan updates, curated content, reminders, supplement recommendations, or wellness product offerings. You control what’s offered and how much time you commit. Most subscriptions run asynchronously, meaning no live sessions are required."},
      {"q": "Why would I offer a subscription for only $20 or $30/month?", "a": "Low-cost subscriptions lower the barrier to entry for your clients and create consistent, scalable revenue for you. One hundred clients at $20 per month already generate $2000 per month. As your client base grows, this can result in $10,000 or more in passive or flexible income, without requiring additional sessions. The real value is in scale, automation, and retention."},
      {"q": "Is the income truly passive?", "a": "Essentially, it is. If you sell an eBook or share a digital guide that clients subscribe to, that’s passive income. Other income streams are flexible but require minimal asynchronous interaction, like updating care plans or responding to occasional check-ins. You decide what you offer and how involved you want to be."},
      {"q": "I’m not tech-savvy. Will I be able to use Vybri?", "a": "Yes. Vybri is designed for providers, not programmers. You can launch your digital practice in under 30 minutes, even if you have no prior technical experience. You also have the option to use our concierge service to set up your account, services, and content on Vybri. The interface is intuitive, and every core function can be accessed with just a few clicks."},
      {"q": "How does Vybri help with client engagement?", "a": "Clients receive care plans through a clean, modern app experience—one that mirrors the kind of user interfaces they already expect from top health and wellness platforms. Built-in reminders, progress check-ins, and smart notifications keep them engaged long after your initial session ends."},
      {"q": "Can Vybri integrate with my existing client list?", "a": "Yes. You can import your current clients via a simple file upload or integrate your address book or CRM for automatic updates to client information. Once added, you can start sending resources, creating care plans, and offering subscriptions immediately. Vybri scales whether you have 50 or 5,000 clients."},
      {"q": "What kind of content can I create on Vybri?", "a": "You can generate blogs, eBooks, client guides, podcasts, short videos, and social posts—based entirely on your wellness expertise. Start with raw notes, session transcripts, or even just a voice recording. Vybri transforms this into engaging digital content, automatically branded and ready for publication."},
      {"q": "Can I track which clients are engaging with my content?", "a": "Yes. Your dashboard shows client engagement rates, subscription revenue, and overall digital impact. You can track which topics resonate most, identify which clients are most engaged, and pinpoint areas that require additional content."},
      {"q": "Is Vybri HIPAA-compliant?", "a": "Vybri is built to be HIPAA-ready and is optimized for non-diagnostic, wellness-oriented care. We do not generate or store diagnoses or prescriptions. All client data is securely stored, and providers (you) remain entirely in control of what is shared and how it’s used."},
      {"q": "Can I customize what metrics clients track?", "a": "Yes. Clients can track metrics that matter to them, such as sleep, energy levels, mood, or weight. This data helps tailor future plans and allows you to deliver more personalized, meaningful care. These metrics are visible to you in your dashboard and can inform future guidance."},
      {"q": "What if I already use another platform?", "a": "Vybri is designed to complement—not replace—your existing tools. You can use it alongside your EHR (or patient records management), payment systems, or scheduling platforms. Vybri focuses on what most platforms don’t: building client trust, generating new income streams, and extending your influence through digital tools."},
      {"q": "How do I get started?", "a": "You can launch your practice on Vybri for free in under 30 minutes. Set up your profile, upload or create a few digital resources, and start inviting clients. For a more hands-off experience, choose our concierge setup service, and we’ll take care of the setup for you."},
      {"q": "What does Vybri cost?", "a": "Client engagement and launching subscriptions are free to start. You only pay as you grow—20% per transaction for subscriptions or services. Optional marketing and concierge services are available with fixed monthly or one-time fees, tailored to your specific needs."},
      {"q": "Can I use Vybri to expand nationally or beyond my local market?", "a": "Yes. Because Vybri supports asynchronous digital care and informational content—not medical treatment—your reach is not limited by licensing or geography. You can expand your brand nationwide or even internationally."}
